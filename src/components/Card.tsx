                <p>"Witches are individuals with special powers like ESP, telekinesis, mind control, etc.
                    (not the typical hogwart and newt potions). Robin, a 15-year-old craft user, arrives from Italy to
                    Japan to work for an organization named STN Japan Division (STN-J) as a replacement for one of
                    STN-J's witch hunters who was recently killed. Unlike other divisions of STN, STN-J tries to
                    capture the witches alive in order to learn why and how they became witches in the first place.
